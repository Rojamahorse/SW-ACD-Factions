		Lore1 = "The Confederacy of Independent Systems, also known as the Separatists, was a galactic faction formed during the tumultuous era of the Clone Wars, advocating for the autonomy of star systems and seeking to break away from the Galactic Republic's central authority."
		
		Lore2 = "Originally conceived as a political movement to address grievances against the perceived corruption and bureaucracy of the Republic, the Confederacy grew into a formidable faction under the leadership of Count Dooku, a former Jedi Master who became the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus. Secretly manipulated by Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord who would later become Emperor Palpatine, the Separatists served as a tool in the Sith's plan to destabilize the Republic and ultimately pave the way for the rise of the Galactic Empire."
		
		Lore3 = "The Confederacy garnered support from various star systems and corporate entities disillusioned with the Republic's perceived inefficiency and favoritism towards the Core Worlds. Key members of the Separatist cause included powerful corporations such as the Trade Federation, the Techno Union, and the Banking Clan, which provided vast resources and battle droids for the Separatist military."
		
		Lore4 = "The backbone of the Separatist military force was its vast army of battle droids, including B1 battle droids (commonly known as battle droids) and B2 super battle droids. These droids allowed the Confederacy to field massive armies at a relatively low cost, challenging the Republic's clone army on various fronts."
		
		Lore5 = "Though the Confederacy claimed to champion the cause of autonomy and independence, their methods often involved ruthless tactics and military aggression. Countless worlds were embroiled in the conflict, leading to devastating battles and loss of life. The most iconic symbol of the Confederacy's military might was the formidable droid control ship, a massive vessel that coordinated the actions of its vast droid armies during large-scale engagements."

		Lore1 = "The Galactic Empire is an authoritarian regime that emerged from the ashes of the Clone Wars, consolidating power under the leadership of Emperor Palpatine with the promise of bringing stability and order to the galaxy."

		Lore2 = "Formed on the foundation of the former Galactic Republic, the Empire was the brainchild of Emperor Palpatine, also known as Darth Sidious, who manipulated political events to orchestrate the Republic's transformation into a centralized and autocratic government. Palpatine exploited the fear and chaos of the Clone Wars to instill public support for his emergency powers, ultimately declaring himself Emperor and dissolving the Republic's democratic institutions."

		Lore3 = "With its capital on the ecumenopolis of Coruscant, the Empire extended its reach across the galaxy, enforcing its rule through a vast military force known as the Imperial Army and Navy. Stormtroopers, the faceless soldiers clad in white armor, symbolized the might and uniformity of the Imperial military. The Empire's dark enforcers, the Sith Lords, including Darth Vader, were feared and wielded the power of the dark side of the Force."

		Lore4 = "The Imperial fleet comprised an array of technologically advanced warships, including the colossal Imperial-class Star Destroyers and the moon-sized Death Star battle stations. These intimidating vessels were used to project Imperial power and maintain control over star systems through displays of overwhelming force."

		Lore5 = "While the Empire presented itself as a force for order and progress, its rule was marked by oppression, fear, and the suppression of individual freedoms. Planets that dared to challenge Imperial authority faced brutal consequences, often leading to the use of superweapons or massed military forces to crush dissent. The infamous destruction of Alderaan, a peaceful world, served as a chilling example of the Empire's willingness to exert its dominance."

Over time, it grew to encompass thousands of star systems, each represented in the Galactic Senate on the capital world of Coruscant."
		
		Lore3 = "The Jedi Order played a crucial role in the Republic's governance, serving as peacekeepers and diplomats across the galaxy. As guardians of peace and justice, the Jedi Knights adhered to a strict code, striving to maintain balance and harmony in the Force.

Bureaucracy and political maneuvering often hindered swift action, allowing discontent and disenchantment to fester in some regions.
