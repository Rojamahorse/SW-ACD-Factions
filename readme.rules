Readme Notes on modding Cosmoteer:
DISCLAIMER: I am not a programmer, and I am not an experienced programmer. I am just a hobbyist who is trying to learn how to mod Cosmoteer. I am not responsible for any damages or problems that may arise from using this information.
Most of this information has been AI generated from the .dll files using ILSpy & by using Cody, an AI tool that utilizes ChatGPT & Claude to create embeddings in my repositories to help me search through and better understand the code.  I will eventually add this to the Cosmoteer Wiki, if it has proven useful. 

Below are my findings:

Definition of HitEffectsScaleOverRange
The snippet you've provided from the .dll files gives you an insight into the HitEffectsScaleOverRange data field used in Cosmoteer. Here's a breakdown of the key components and what they imply for modding:

Namespaces:

using Halfling;
using Halfling.PortableHashing;
using Halfling.Serialization;
These lines indicate that the HitEffectsScaleOverRange field is using classes and methods from the Halfling library, which is a part of Cosmoteer's underlying software architecture, likely handling serialization (the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file) and possibly related to security or data integrity (hashing).

Attributes:

[Serialize(Optional = true)]: This attribute specifies that the field is optional for serialization. In the context of modding, this means that you do not need to explicitly define this field in your mod files; the game will function properly without it.
[PortableHash]: This attribute likely indicates that this field is included when calculating a hash for the object, which could be important for data verification or ensuring consistency.
Field Declaration:

public Range<float> HitEffectsScaleOverRange;
This declaration reveals that HitEffectsScaleOverRange is a public field (meaning it can be accessed and modified outside of its class) and it uses a Range<float> type. Range<float> is presumably a structure or class defined either in Cosmoteer or the Halfling library, representing a range of floating-point numbers. This field likely defines a range for scaling hit effects, possibly adjusting the intensity or size of visual or auditory effects when a hit occurs in the game, based on some factor (like distance or damage).

Practical Use in Modding
When modding, if you decide to use the HitEffectsScaleOverRange field in your .rules files or other configurations:

Optional: Remember that this field is optional; if you don't specify it, the game will use default behaviors.
Value Type: Ensure that you provide a range of floating-point numbers (e.g., 0.5-1.5), which likely controls how effects scale over some variable, such as distance from the target or the range over which an effect diminishes or increases.
If you are defining custom effects or modifying existing effects for weapons or interactions in Cosmoteer and want these effects to scale under certain conditions, adjusting the HitEffectsScaleOverRange could be a powerful tool. For example, you might want a weapon's hit effects to be more pronounced at closer ranges but diminish as the range increases. This setup could be specified by configuring this field appropriately in your mod's configuration files.
*/

/* Additional Notes: 
Scales the hit effects of the ion beam weapon over its range.
The hit effects are scaled linearly from 1 at the weapon's minimum range to 1 - (range / 1000) at the weapon's maximum range.
At range 1, the damage would be 1
At max range (300), the damage would be 1 - (300 / 1000) = 0.7 
*/

// ExampleA: 
HitEffectsScaleOverRange = [1, 0.1]
// ExampleB: 
HitEffectsScaleOverRange = [1, 1 - (range / 1000)]

/* FACTIONS */

/* GRID SPRITES */

/*
floor.rules sprite grid configuration:
This code defines a sprite grid configuration for the floor of the Ion Thruster 01 module, which is 20 units wide by 26 units long.
The purpose is to create a visual representation of the floor using different sprite images. It takes no direct inputs. The output is a sprite grid that is rendered to show the floor.
It works by defining a grid with dimensions 20x26 at the location [0.5, 0.5]. This places the grid centered in the module.
Inside the grid definition, it specifies 5 different sets of 5 floor tile sprites. The sprites are located in the "../Ion_Common/" folder and represent floor tiles with 0%, 33%, and 66% damage.
When rendered, the grid will randomly select one of the 5 sprite sets on each row. Within each set, the 5 floor tile sprites will be placed across the row from left to right.
This allows the floor to be visualized with random variations in damage across its surface. The random UV rotation also randomly rotates each sprite for added variation.
In summary, it defines a randomized grid of floor tile sprites to create a visually interesting floor for the module that appears damaged in different areas. The grid itself requires no input and outputs a sprite visualization.
*/

/*
 * Defines a sprite grid for the floor of the Ion Thruster 01 (20x26) module.
 * The grid contains 5 different floor tile sprites that are randomly placed across the 20x26 grid.
 * The tile sprites are located in the "../Ion_Common/" directory and have varying damage levels (0%, 33%, 66%).
 * This sprite grid is used to create the visual representation of the floor for this thruster module.
*/
/*
The location in Cosmoteer sprite grid rules refers to the position of the top left corner of the grid relative to the center of the module.
So [0.5, 0.5] places the top left corner of this 20x26 grid at the exact center of the 64x64 module.
This centers the floor grid within the module sprite visually.
If it was [0, 0] instead, the top left corner would be at the true top left of the module. [1, 1] would put the top left at the bottom right.
By using [0.5, 0.5] it ensures that regardless of the grid size, it will be centered in the middle of the module sprite. This provides the desired visual look of a centered floor.
The key thing is that the location coordinates are relative to the center of the module sprite, not the absolute pixel coordinates. This allows flexibility in grid placement within the module.
